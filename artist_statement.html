         <p>I make installations that capture and digitally replicate an analogue experience and the sensory condition from which it is produced.<br><br></p>
 
        <p>My research has been focused around the replication of sensory environmental inputs. I look at systems of making and the metamorphosis of skill, and visualise the made object as a synthetic and symbiotic product of Maker, process and biophysical environment.<br><br></p>
 
        <p>I work with generative electronic systems that use sensors and repurposed electronic objects to monitor and digitally reproduce environmental variations in the immediate surroundings.<br><br></p>
 
        <p>Each system behaves as an electronic network of cause and effect that transforms information from organic to electronic (inorganic) form.  Each system is designed to respond to a particular sensory input.  In doing so, the information is necessarily distorted and recycled back into the same environment for re-interpretation by the same system.<br><br></p>
 
        <p>I use hand made and recycled electronic objects, sensors, microcontrollers and off-grid technologies to create modular systems. The systems are playful and self-sufficient so the electricity is contained and quantifiable within the same input-output cycle.  I am interested in how generative, off-grid technologies can be meaningfully situated within urban spaces where the energy produced is directly fed back into a quantifiable electronic action for viewer (human) experience.<br><br></p>
 
        <p>I am interested in the transduction of elemental energy into electricity, the mutation of sensory information through a digital sieve and the translation of human experience in a digital brain.</p>
